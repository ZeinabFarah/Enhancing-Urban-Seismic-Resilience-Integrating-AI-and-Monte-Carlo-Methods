# Enhancing Urban Seismic Resilience: Integrating AI and Monte Carlo Methods for Real-Time Hazard Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and supplementary modules used to study the seismic resilience of water distribution systems in Shelby County, TN. The project employs machine learning techniques to predict and visualize the impact of seismic events on the serviceability of water infrastructure.

## Data Sources
The data used in this study is sourced from:
- **In-Core**: Detailed infrastructure data available at [In-Core website](https://incore.ncsa.illinois.edu/)
- **U.S. Census**: Demographic data for Shelby County, TN

## Repository Structure
- `main_notebook.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook includes all the main analysis steps, visualizations, and results.
- `modules`: This directory contains separate Python modules that define functions and classes used in the main notebook.
